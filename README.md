# IST215C_Project
Purpose of this project is to help my students learn to develop a simple WPF .NET 5.0 application. This project has a lot of little things like menu, command key, reading a file and loading data grid, file browser, folder browser, saving settings etc. I am hoping other could make some contribution by improving exiting application and/or add new features.
